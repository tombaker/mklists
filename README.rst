MkLists documentation
---------------------

Sync your lists to evolving rules.

Deploy docs
-----------

In principle, documentation should automatically be
deployed on ReadTheDocs on every push or merged pull
request.  As of 2020-02-14, this does not yet work.

See: https://mklists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

The PyPI package will soon be updated.
